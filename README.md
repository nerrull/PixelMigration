PixelMigration
==============
Pixels from a source image migrate to new positions to resemble target image.
Frames are exported for easy conversion to gif or video files.

Uses a reversible quicksort based on pixel colors to correlate the two images and migrates the pixels between them.
Multiple images can be chained.

Not super efficient right now, the pixel-agents are too heavy. Pictures are now loaded dynamically. Speed is mainly dicatated by resolution.
