PixelMigration
==============
Pixels from a source image migrate to new positions to resemble target image.
Frames are exported for easy conversion to gif or video files.

Uses a reversible quicksort weighted by the pixel color to correlate the two images and migrates the pixels between them.
Multiple images can be chained. Number is just limited by your RAM. 

Not super efficient right now, loads everything into the pixel-agents. Could load the pictures dynamically. I'll get on that eventually. Speed is mainly dicatated by resolution.
